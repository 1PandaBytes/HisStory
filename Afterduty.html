        <p>William Malcolm was welcomed home with open arms by his family, having served bravely during his time. He was heartily congratulated repeatedly by his father, and was awarded a gold-medallion of bravery by the Prime Minister. He also received a steady source of income from the government and was granted a soldier's pension. However, William suffered immensely from Post Traumatic Trauma but his family, being the proud beings they were, failed to support him adequately though this. He took his own life 5 years later. </p>
